// JavaScript Program To Work With Constants


/* Javascript const keyword is used to create a constant variable. The value of the constant cannot be changed 


Syntex : const variable_name = value;


*/

// Example : 
const pi = 3.14;
console.log(pi);


// In the above example, the value of PI cannot be changed as it is decalred using const keyword 
 // Javascript program to change the value of constat

 // you cannot change the value of a constant, but you can change the properties of a constant
 // if it is an object 
 
 
 const PI = {
  value: 3.14
 };

 console.log(PI);

 PI.value = 3.142
 console.log(PI);
 // In the above example, you can see that the value of the PI constant is changed form 3.14 to 3.142
